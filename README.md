## Description

A user can track their budget with this Progressive Web Application. Any given user can enter deposits and expenses that are tracked on a table by value and time. The total funds avaibable are updated at the top of the application. This application can be downloaded to a device or remain on the web. If the application loses connection, the user can still enter transactions that will update when they re-connect to the internet.
